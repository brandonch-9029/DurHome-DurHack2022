DurHome

Durham is a wonderful place to study. With its colleges scattered across the Bailey and Hill, the entire town feels like campus. However, like most other student cities, securing student housing is competitive and stressful, especially as the University is expanding faster than the City. The result: a mad dash to view properties and sign rental agreements within a very short period of time when listings go online every November.

To make things worse, house listings are randomly listed among several popular websites with Desktop and Mobile UI and UX of wildly differing quality, resulting in a stressful and tedious housing search, especially when you are traversing a forest, unsure if your next viewing is even confirmed.

I am in the process of building DurHome, a program that intends to quickly filter out eligible properties based on user requirements, then lays out all the crucial information to the user, supporting their decision-making process.
